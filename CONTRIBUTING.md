# Contributing

## Purpose and Scope

This file here is for all developers who will or are contributing to this project (e.g. Commits, Merge requests, etc.)
It contains some guides on how you can make sure that your changes will get approved.

## Getting Started

To set up the Project, just clone it. You can then see the [README.md](README.md) for the installation/setup guide.

## Guidelines for Contributions

1. Whenever you are taking on a story from the [Kanban](Kanban), make sure you set it to the correct bucket (e.g. "In development" or "Under review" etc.)
2. For every new feature or bugfix, you will create a new branch with an understandable name. Example: `refactor/remove-hard-coded-variables` or `feature/implement-authentication-system`
3. Make sure you understand your code. You may be asked to explain why you did something a certain way.
4. Before committing, or at least before creating a MR, pease make sure that your code is formatted properly.
5. Make sure your Commit messages follow the `conventional commits`.

## Pull Requests

1. After being done with a feature/bugfix/etc, open up a MR to `develop`(!). MRs into `master` will be declined unless they were in `develop` first.
2. Make sure that the `README.md` is up-to-date with your new changes.
